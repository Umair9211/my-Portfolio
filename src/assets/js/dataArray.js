    Hey, I’m Umair — a web developer passionate about building clean, user-focused websites.

    My journey started with curiosity and grew into a strong interest in how websites are made. I mainly work on the front end, using tools like React, Bootstrap, and JavaScript to create responsive and interactive designs that feel smooth and modern.

    I’ve completed several projects, and each one has taught me something new — whether it's writing cleaner code, improving performance, or designing better user flows.
    While front-end is where I feel most confident, I’ve also started dipping into back-end development, experimenting with APIs, databases, and authentication flows. I'm not fully there yet, but I’m actively learning and working towards becoming a full-stack developer who can handle both sides of the stack.
    Every project, tutorial, or bug I fix adds to my skillset. I believe in growing by doing — and that’s exactly what I’m here to keep doing.

  I’m Umair — an aspiring Network Engineer who’s passionate about understanding and shaping the way systems communicate. Networking, to me, is the invisible backbone that powers everything we do online — and I’m fascinated by the logic, precision, and architecture behind it.

  I have a solid grasp of core networking concepts like IP addressing, subnetting, routing, switching, VLANs, NAT, DHCP, and DNS. I've spent time working with simulation tools like Cisco Packet Tracer and Wireshark to design, analyze, and troubleshoot network topologies — building my hands-on experience in both theoretical and practical aspects.

  Beyond the basics, I’m developing a deeper understanding of how data flows across layers of the OSI and TCP/IP models, and how protocols like OSPF, EIGRP, and BGP enable efficient and reliable routing. I'm learning to configure routers and switches, implement ACLs (Access Control Lists), and apply security measures that ensure network resilience.

  I believe that in a world that’s constantly connected, mastering networks isn’t just about cables and configs — it’s about creating systems that are fast, secure, and scalable. Whether it’s setting up small-scale LANs or understanding enterprise-level WAN strategies, I’m continuously challenging myself to grow as a network professional.

  My goal is to become a certified and skilled Network Engineer who not only understands the infrastructure but can also innovate within it. I'm committed to continuous learning, hands-on experimentation, and staying current with the ever-evolving technologies that keep the world connected.

  I’m Umair — a rising Cybersecurity Analyst with a growing passion for defending systems and understanding the ever-evolving landscape of digital threats. Although cybersecurity is the newest of my core tech interests, it’s quickly becoming one of the most exciting areas I explore.

  My focus includes areas like vulnerability assessment, threat modeling, and the OWASP Top 10. I’m also building a strong foundation in security fundamentals like firewalls, encryption, access control, and secure coding practices. I’ve begun exploring real-world scenarios through labs and simulations to test and reinforce my knowledge.

  For me, cybersecurity isn’t just about defense — it’s about staying curious, thinking critically, and being proactive. I believe every system, no matter how small, deserves to be secure. Whether I’m analyzing network packets or studying exploit techniques, I’m always striving to think like an attacker so I can respond like a defender.

  My goal is to become a skilled, ethical cybersecurity professional who can assess risks, secure infrastructure, and contribute to a safer digital world. I’m committed to learning continuously, staying updated on threats, and practicing hands-on skills every step of the way.
